# Tarot Card Application

## Overview
This project is a Tarot card application that allows users to shuffle, deal, and interact with Tarot cards. 

## Completed Tasks
1. **Improved UI**:
   - Used  Tailwind to create a user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

   - Implemented a randomized shuffling algorithm

   - Cards animate forward when hovered, improving visibility and interactivity.

## Future Enhancements

 **Preload Assets**:
	- Load all assets (images, sounds, etc.) beforehand to ensure smoother interactions and reduce delays during gameplay.

 **Add History**:
   - Implement a feature to save and display the history of previous card draws for users to revisit.

 **Color Scheme**:
   - Introduce a more cohesive and visually appealing color scheme to enhance the overall UI.

**Better Icons and Buttons**:
   - Design custom icons and buttons to improve the user experience and make the interface more engaging.

**Enhanced Animations**:
   - Add smoother and more dynamic animations for card shuffling, dealing, and interactions.

**Sound Effects**:
   - Include subtle sound effects for actions like shuffling, dealing, and hovering over cards.



## If I Was Given 1 Week of Development Time
If I had a full week to develop this application, I would focus on the following:

**Advanced Gamification**:
   - Introduce a fortune-telling adventure mode where users can draw cards to unlock unique storylines or outcomes.
   - Add a daily challenge feature with personalized tasks or messages based on the cards drawn.
   - Implement a progression system with unlockable card designs, themes, and achievements.

With a full week of development time, these features would enhance the app's functionality, engagement, and overall user experience, making it a playable Tarot card application.
